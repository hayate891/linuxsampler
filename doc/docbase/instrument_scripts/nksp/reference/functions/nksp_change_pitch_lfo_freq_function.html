    <p>
      This function can be used to modify the pitch LFO frequency of active
      voices. Since LFOs are per voice, you need to pass the note ID(s) of
      the voices you want to alter. This function will change the pitch
      LFO frequency of all active voices associated with the requested note.
      So if you are using a layered instrument patch, then it will change
      the pitch LFO frequency of all layers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The LFO frequency changes set by calling this function are always applied relatively to
      all other LFO frequency sources defined for controlling the LFO (i.e. an internal
      constant LFO frequency value, an associated MIDI controller defined in the instrument
      preset to control the LFO frequency, etc.).
      Or in other words: the <code lang="nksp">??frequency??</code> value passed to this
      function will not replace the overall LFO frequency, it will rather be multiplied
      against all other LFO frequency control sources.
    </p>

    <note class="important">
    There will only be audible changes with this function if the pitch LFO is
    actually already turned on (i.e. by enabling it in the instrument patch)
    and only if the LFO is not disabled by other LFO control sources. So you may for
    example set a certain constant internal LFO depth value with the instrument preset
    first, before actually making use of this function.
    </note>

    <note>
    Release Trigger Samples: In case the affected voices cause release trigger
    samples to be spawned later on, the LFO of those release trigger voices
    will not be affected by this function at all. So if you need to control the
    LFO of release trigger samples by script, then you might rather also trigger
    those release trigger samples by script with <code lang="nksp">play_note()</code>
    instead of using the sampler format's internal support for release trigger samples.
